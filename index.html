        <h1>What is Responsbl?</h1>
        <p>
            Responsbl is a little side project I created to help with my own mental battles in life.<br\>
            I wanted something to occupy my mind and test my abilities while also helping others with <br\>
            their own mental struggles. I learned through many hours of self-help books, self-reflection <br\>
            meditation that we are Responsible for our own lives. It sounds simple but, it's really not. <br\>
            Many of us fail to grasp that we are truly responsible for every aspect in our lives, even <br\>
            the things outside of our control. I may get hit by a bus and lose a limb and yes the person <br\>
            driving is still responsible as-well but, you are responsible for how you choose to react to <br\>
            that situation in your life. You could let it defeat you or you could let it empower you.
